Hi! I am Yurui Jin. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Robotics, a joint program offered by the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and [UWE Bristol](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/), within the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Previously, I obtained my BEng in Mechatronics and Robotics System from the University of Liverpool.

My research interests lie in robot motion planning, control systems, and mechanical design. I am highly passionate about bridging software algorithms with hardware deployment, with extensive hands-on experience in ROS, embedded systems (STM32, Arduino), and 3D modeling (SolidWorks).

During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in the **RoboMaster University Championship**, where I designed suspension systems and robotic arms, leading our team to win multiple national and regional awards. Furthermore, I have been deeply involved in academic research. I co-authored a paper on a variable stiffness gripper which was accepted by the *IEEE CASE* conference, and I also hold a patent for an adaptive pipeline polishing robot.

I am always eager to explore innovative robotic solutions and tackle real-world engineering challenges!
