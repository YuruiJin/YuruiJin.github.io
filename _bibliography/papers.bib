  abstract={The variable stiffness grippers predominantly change the stiffness in two ways: 1) incorporating soft materials but suffering from limited repeatability and high sensitivity to environmental changes; 2) utilizing mechanical structures but suffering from limited stiffness modulation range and heavy self-weight. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel variable stiffness gripper with dual leaf-spring mechanism. The dual leaf-spring gripper (DLSG) incorporates symmetrical pairs of roller bearings to constrain the leaf-spring's vertical deflection at the point of contact, while the stiffness modulation is achieved by changing the effective length of the leaf spring. Advantages with our design includes: 1) wide range of stiffness modulation, 2) compact mechatronic design, and 3) low self-weight. The stiffness modulation and grasping operation are independently controlled by two DC motors.},
