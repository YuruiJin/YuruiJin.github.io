This project presents a variable stiffness gripper utilizing a dual leaf-spring mechanism, enabling adaptive grasping across objects of varying compliance.
The gripper was presented at the 2024 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM).

Key features:
- Dual leaf-spring mechanism for passive compliance control
- Variable stiffness actuation for robust grasping
- Compact mechanical design suitable for robotic manipulation tasks
