If you are wondering how to systematically build your skills as a robotics engineer, I highly recommend the Zhihu article [**机器人工程师学习计划**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22266788) by blogger **YY硕**. Although written in Chinese, it provides one of the most comprehensive and well-organized roadmaps I have come across for anyone entering the field of robotics.

## Key Learning Areas

The article outlines several core competencies that every robotics engineer should develop:

### 1. Mathematical Foundations

A solid math background is indispensable. This includes:

- **Linear algebra** – essential for representing transformations, robot kinematics, and state-space models.
- **Calculus and differential equations** – needed for dynamics modeling and control design.
- **Probability and statistics** – the backbone of state estimation, sensor fusion, and machine learning.
- **Optimization** – key for motion planning, parameter tuning, and learning-based methods.

### 2. Programming Skills

- **C++** – the dominant language for real-time robot control, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
- **Python** – widely used for rapid prototyping, data analysis, and machine learning workflows.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)** – the de-facto middleware for building robot software systems. Familiarity with ROS/ROS2 is increasingly essential for both academic research and industry.

### 3. Control Theory

Understanding classical and modern control is fundamental:

- PID control
- State-space representation and state feedback
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Adaptive and robust control methods

### 4. Motion Planning

Robots need to plan safe and efficient trajectories:

- Configuration space and workspace concepts
- Sampling-based planners (RRT, PRM)
- Optimization-based trajectory planning
- Reactive and behavior-based approaches

### 5. Computer Vision and Perception

Robots must perceive and understand their environment:

- Camera models and calibration
- Feature detection and matching
- 3D reconstruction and depth estimation
- Deep learning for object detection and segmentation

### 6. Mechanical Design

Hardware knowledge is often underestimated but essential:

- Kinematics and mechanism design
- Actuator selection (DC motors, servo motors, pneumatics)
- Structural design considerations and manufacturing constraints

## Why I Recommend This Article

The article strikes a good balance between breadth and depth, making it suitable for both beginners deciding where to start and intermediate learners identifying gaps in their knowledge. The author draws from practical engineering experience, offering advice that goes beyond textbook theory.
