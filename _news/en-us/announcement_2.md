As a core member of the team, I was responsible for the mechanical and suspension design of our infantry and engineering robots. This was a culmination of months of hard work on designing and optimizing suspension systems and robotic arm mechanisms.

The RoboMaster University Championship is one of the most prestigious robotics competitions in China, bringing together top engineering talents from universities across the nation.
